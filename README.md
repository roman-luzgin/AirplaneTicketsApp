## Description
This is a recreation of the Airplane Ticket App, the design for which was found on Dribble, in SwiftUI. Most of the design is recreated based on the original, but some Swift-native elements, like Picker, DatePicker, or Toggle were used instead of those on the design just for easier functionality.

#### Usage
There are 4 cities with airports added to the app: San Francisco, London, Paris, and Berlin. Use one of these cities to check functionality.

#### Libraries
No external libraries were used, the app is done 100% in SwifUI. A couple of extensions may be used.

#### Localization
Localizable.string files for English and Russian (both empty except for 1 string) were already added to the project to make it more convenient. You can use the example in GetStartedView and localize the entire app in the furure if needed.
